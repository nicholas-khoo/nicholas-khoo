### About Me

Hello there, my name is Nicholas. Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am currently an Application Consultant working with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore enabling the adoption of corporate bsuiness applications for whole-of-government.

I am passionate about all things related to DATA :computer: and am currently enrolled in the Data Science Immersive Flex course with General Assembly. During the course, I'll be working on multiple projects which I would like to share with the public.

Do not be shy! Explore some of the projects I've made using the existing knowledge acquired throughout my journey into the deep realms of data science. All analyses and comments are completely personal and are in no representative of the organisation whom I work for.

If you have any feedback for my projects or would simply like to bounce off ideas? Reach me at:</br>
