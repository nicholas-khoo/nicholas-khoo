### About Me

Hello there, my name is Nicholas. Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am currently an Application Consultant working with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, where I enable the adoption of corporate business applications for the whole-of-government.

I am passionate about all things related to data :computer: and am currently enrolled in the Data Science Immersive Flex course with General Assembly. I'll be working on multiple projects during this period and would like to share my journey into the deep realms of data science with you! </br>

Don't be shy! Click into any of the repositories and explore some of my personal projects. Please note that all views expressed in my projects are entirely my own and do not reflect the views of the organisations with which I am or have been affiliated in my professional life. </br>

If you have feedback for any of my projects or would simply like to connect to bounce off ideas, feel free reach me at:</br>
