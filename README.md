### About Me

Hello there, my name is Nicholas. Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am currently working as a Business Analyst with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, where I facilitate the adoption of corporate business applications for the entire government.

I am passionate about everything related to data, and am currently enrolled in the Data Science Immersive Flex course with General Assembly. During this period, I will be working on multiple projects and would love to share my journey into the deep realms of data science with you!

Please don't hesitate to click into any of the repositories and explore some of my personal projects. Kindly note that all opinions expressed in my projects are solely my own and do not reflect the views of the organizations with which I am or have been affiliated in my professional life.

If you have any feedback for my projects or would simply like to connect and exchange ideas, feel free to contact me at:
